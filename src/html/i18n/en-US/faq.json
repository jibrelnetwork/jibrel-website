        "answer": [
          "Crypto Depository Receipts are smart contracts that represent the value of a real-world asset.  Users can convert Jibrel Network Tokens (JNT) into CryDRs representing fiat currencies, commodities, bonds or even securities.  CryDRs can be transferred to another individual or entity, who can redeem the token for the underlying value in JNT with the Jibrel DAO. CryDRs have smart regulation embedded, meaning all transactions are KYC / AML compliant."

      {
        "question": "What is Smart Regulation?",
        "answer": [
          "CryDRs are governed by a set of rules deployed to the blockchain to ensure they are compliant with any relevant regulation based on asset class and jurisdiction."

      {
        "question": "How does Smart Regulation work?",
        "answer": [
          "Real world rules are translated into Solidity code which is deployed as a rulebook for CryDRs to follow on the Ethereum blockchain.",
          "Smart Regulation ensures that while CryDRs are decentralized, they always follow real world regulation. Governance without governments."

        "answer": [
          "Liquid assets are transferred to and held by the Jibrel AG Fund in Zug, Switzerland. Illiquid assets are securitized using JNT as the underlying currency. All transactions involving the tokenized asset are conducted using JNT."

      {
        "question": "What is on-chain / off-chain arbitrage?",
        "answer": [
          "Due to the volatility of cryptocurrencies, primarily driven by speculation and liquidity bottlenecks, stable on-chain assets become especially valuable. If a traditional asset is tokenized successfully, and the community has a strong belief that this token is redeemable at any future date for the underlying asset, the value of the asset on-chain becomes more valuable than the original off-chain purchase price. This is due to the scarcity of stable assets on-chain. We call this on-chain / off-chain arbitrage."

          "The Jibrel Network Token (JNT) is a virtual currency used to purchase / redeem CryDRs. In addition, any value exchange associated with the securitized off-chain assets are transacted using Jibrel Network Token. Finally, CryDR transfers consume small amounts of JNT in the form of jGas."
        ]
      },
      {
        "question": "Why is a dedicated token needed as opposed to ETH or BTC?",
        "answer": [
          "Given the extreme volatility of ETH and BTC, it would be difficult to hold liabilities in fiat currency (CryDRs) while holding volatile and uncorrelated crypto assets. Using JNT, a closed system is established allowing for the system to self-balance.
