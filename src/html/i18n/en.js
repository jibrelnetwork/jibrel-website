Users can convert Jibrel Network Token (JNT) into CryDRs representing fiat currencies, commodities, bonds or even securities.

If a traditional asset is tokenized successfully, and the community has a strong belief that this token is redeemable at any future date for the underlying asset, the value of the asset on-chain becomes more valuable than the original off-chain purchase price.
