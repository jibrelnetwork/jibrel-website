                                <p>Crypto Depository Receipts are smart contracts that represent the value of a real-world asset.  Users can convert Jibrel Network Token (JNT) into CryDRs representing fiat currencies, commodities, bonds or even securities.  CryDRs can be transferred to another individual or entity, who can redeem the token for the underlying value in JNT with the Jibrel DAO. CryDRs have smart regulation embedded, meaning all transactions are KYC / AML compliant.</p>

                                <p>Due to the volatility of crypto-currencies, primarily driven by speculation and liquidity bottlenecks, stable on-chain assets become especially valuable. If a traditional asset is tokenized successfully, and the community has a strong belief that this token is redeemable at any future date for the underlying asset, the value of the asset on-chain becomes more valuable than the original off-chain purchase price. This is due to the scarcity of stable assets on-chain. We call this on-chain / off-chain arbitrage.</p>
